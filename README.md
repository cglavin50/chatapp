### Basic Chat App With React and Firebase
Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88&list=PL0vfts4VzfNjfHKRKkMjm_xUXglH6HtL1&index=8) tutorial, I am building out a basic web chat-app in React, using Firebase to manage the DB and Authentication. Planning to test varying settings as well as learn about push notifications via Firebase, as well as only allowing this to specified groups, ex Georgetown students.
