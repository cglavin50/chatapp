### Basic Chat App With React and Firebase
Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88&list=PL0vfts4VzfNjfHKRKkMjm_xUXglH6HtL1&index=8) tutorial, I am building out a basic web chat-app in React, using Firebase to manage the DB and Authentication. Planning to test varying settings as well as learn about push notifications via Firebase, as well as only allowing this to specified groups, ex Georgetown students.
## To Do
1. Clean up front-end UI, especially scrolling issue
2. Create firebase and front-end functions to specify allowed domains (ex to Georgetown) for Google SSO login *DONE*
3. Create firebase backend rules to censor, evaluate ban-scheme later 
4. Clean up firebase deployment (working now, need finish configuring GitHub actions later) *DONE*
5. Create mobile alerts and look to use this on the web?
6. Update from the Firebase SDK v8 to v9
